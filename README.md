# xdkim - fork of libdkim 1.0.21

xdkim was forked of libdkim-1.0.21. The libdkim project was marked
as inactive on sourceforge in 2016. libdkim-1.0.21 was the last 
version available at this time.

Initial the code was stripped down, all WIN32 stuff was (hopefully)
removed. The shared library functionality is gone. The libray is
linked statically into the executable xdkim.

xdkim runs on Linux-like systems only.
